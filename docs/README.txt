Version 6.4


1. INTRODUCTION
---------------

GDB Manager 6 is a GUI front-end for KitServer 6 GDB (Graphics DataBase). 
It simplifies the task of defining kit attributes, such as 3D-model of a 
shirt, collar type, name location, name shape, and some others.
GDB Manager will modify (and create, if necessary) the corresponding 
"config.txt" files.


2. USAGE
--------

Run GDBManager.exe. When run first time, it will ask you to select the
location of your "GDB" folder. After that it should show a directory-like
tree on the left side which enumerates all the kits in the GDB. You can
select a kit file there and set/modify attributes in the right panel.
