GDB Manager                                                    June 5, 2007
===========================================================================
Version 6.5


1. INTRODUCTION
---------------

GDB Manager 6 is a GUI front-end for KitServer 6 GDB (Graphics DataBase). 
It simplifies the task of defining kit attributes, such as 3D-model of a 
shirt, collar type, name location, name shape, and some others.
GDB Manager will modify (and create, if necessary) the corresponding 
"config.txt" files.


2. USAGE
--------

Run GDBManager.exe. When run first time, it will ask you to select the
location of your "GDB" folder. After that it should show a directory-like
tree on the left side which enumerates all the kits in the GDB. You can
select a kit file there and set/modify attributes in the right panel.

Kit-mixing is now also support (starting with version 6.5).
Use the controls at the bottom to select folders for your shirt, shorts
and socks. And don't forget to select the proper mask too.
